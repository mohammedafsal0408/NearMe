        Fort St. David was a historic British fort near Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu, built in 1690 on the Coromandel Coast. It served as the British headquarters for South India, played a major role in colonial conflicts with the French, and was named after the patron saint of Wales by Governor Elihu Yale. Today, it exists as ruins situated near the town and the Silver Beach.
